### Step 1: the intitail commit.
i'm creating a repo and copying the contents of astrosphere.
so obvisouly im going to download th zip file and copy it on to my own pc.
note, this is like the third time im doing this.
i then run npm install and try to get the project running on my machine before making the innitiail commit.
